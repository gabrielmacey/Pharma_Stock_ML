# Pharma_Stock_ML

In these tumultuous times a lot of people are asking the question can we look at the past and predict the future.
We decided to take a swipe at the stock market, game stop anyone ?

Questions?
Can we use machine learning to forecast the price of the stock looking at 10 years worth of historical prices ?
Can we apply the same learning algorithm to a different sector ?
Has 24/7 news dissemination and everyone pretending a stock analyst has news overtaken good fundamentals?

With covid vaccines making an appearance we decided to choose pharmaceuticals as our sector to forecast prices. 
Stocks include Astrazeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, J&J, Merck and Pfizer.

Will be able to download data everyday.
Independent variables: Open, Close, Adjusted Close,  High, Low and Volume
